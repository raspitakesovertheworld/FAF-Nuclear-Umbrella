This tool is a reminder for the incredible real time strategy game Forged Alliance Forever (Supreme Commander Forged Alliance) to scout and build nuclear 
missile defenses (Nukes) and also reminds to scout.

I used the text to speech library to speak the notifications, which was super easy. 
Pysimplegui was also very nice and I feel we finally have a GUI toolkit in python that is powerful, yet allows you to build 
a GUI with very little code.
The main loop runs in another thread in parallel to the thread doing the waiting.

Supreme Commander is now over 14 years old and still going strong. It is a one of a kind game with no rival, the scale of
it is still unparalleled, the stratetic zoom is still missing in all other RTSes. The maps are huge, the games epic and 
the learning curve murderous, only the best players can manage it. 
It is the antithesis of all casual games.
