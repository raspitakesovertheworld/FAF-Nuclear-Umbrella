This was a little fun project that was finished suprisingly fast, as always, Python surprises positively.

This tool is a reminder for the incredible real time strategy game Forged Alliance Forever (Supreme Commander Forged Alliance) to scout and build nuclear 
missile defenses (Nukes) and also reminds to scout.

I used the text to speech library to speak the notifications, which was super easy. 
Pysimplegui was also very nice and I feel we finally have a GUI toolkit in python that is powerful, yet allows you to build 
a GUI with very little code.
This also gives a greate opportunity to do some multithreaded code:
The main loop runs in another thread in parallel to the thread doing the waiting.

Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever (the community supported multi player version) is now over 14 years old and still going strong. It is a one of a kind game with no rival, the scale of
it is still unparalleled, the stratetic zoom is still amazing (zoom all the way in and all the way out). The maps are huge, the games epic and 
the learning curve murderous, only the best players can manage it.
