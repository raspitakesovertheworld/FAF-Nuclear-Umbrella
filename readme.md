## Forged Alliance Forever Nuclear Umbrella GUI

By Markus Bawidamann, December 2020
This was a little fun project that was finished suprisingly fast, as always, Python surprises positively.
This tool is a reminder for the real time strategy game Forged Alliance Forever (Supreme Commander 1) to scout and build nuclear 
missile defenses and also reminds to scout.

I used the text to speech library to speak the notifications, which was super easy. 
Pysimplegui was also very nice and I feel we finally have a GUI toolkit in python that is powerful, yet allows you to build 
a GUI with very little code.
The main loop runs in another thread in parallel to the thread doing the waiting.
